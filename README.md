You need to add the zip file to the root directory of your Google drive and then open the ipynb in Google Colab and run.
The TensorBoard did not appear in the existing ipynb, but will work in Google Colab in the Chrome browser using Windows 10. 
For some reason the TensorBoard did not work on FireFox browser.
Please note that the CSV files are generated by the ipynb to hold the data file names and the class of each file name. The CSV files are used by the custom data loader to locate the image files and assign the class label. 
The file best_ForestRiver_Model.model contains the best model found during training. This model can be downloaded and used directly to predict any new Forest/River images.
